# Netflix_Content_Business_analysis

In this project you can learn how to analyze the content strategy of Netflix, a platform known for streaming content. A content dataset is used where it contains data about:
- title
- release date
- language
- content type (TV show or movie)
- availability status 
- viewership hours

Content Strategy Analysis means how content is created, released, distributed, and consumed to achieve specific targets, such as maximizing audience engagement, viewership, brand reach, or revenue. 

Using the data we will get useful insights on which content type is preferred by the audience, the months with significant spikes in viewership hours, more deep analysis on the seasonal trends and release days and the impact that the number of releases have on viewership.
